## Hi there 👋 I am Kavita Adha

**Product and Business Analyst** focused on **Category, Merchandising, Supply Chain, and Operations and Logistics analytics**.  

I enjoy working on problems where strategy meets execution: segmentation, value proposition, go-to-market choices, category performance, and operational performance tracking (SQL, Python, Tableau/Power BI, Excel).

**Strategy becomes real when it is measurable my work makes it measurable.**

---

### What I work on 

 - **Product and Brand Strategy:** segmentation, positioning, go-to-market planning, messaging tests, launch readouts, and KPI frameworks
 - **Category and Merchandising analytics:** assortment performance, Stock Keeping Unit productivity, pricing and promotion insights, distribution and velocity
- **Supply chain and operations analytics:** root-cause analysis, process improvement, exception reporting, service-level drivers
- **Business intelligence and reporting:** dashboards, scorecards, metric definitions, stakeholder-ready storytelling
- **Data quality and controls:** validation checks, reconciliation logic, quality assurance so leaders trust the numbers

---


###  Ask me about
- How I translate business questions into **analysis plans**
- Dashboard design that executives actually use (clear metric definitions, exceptions, and actions)
- Communicating insights to non-technical stakeholders (trade-offs, recommendations, next steps)
